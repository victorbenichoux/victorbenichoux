### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻 I currently work at [mayday](https://www.mayday.fr/) on intelligent knowledge bases for customer service

At a past company, we created a useful library to manage ML models called [modelkit](https://github.com/Cornerstone-OnDemand/modelkit)

Check out my other [pet](https://github.com/victorbenichoux/vizno) [projects](https://github.com/victorbenichoux/ticktock) !
